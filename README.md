# DesktopChanger
Changing desktop wallpaper with animation with code!

## How it all began
I saw Wallpaper Engine, and decided that I can do something like this!

## How does it work
I honestly have no idea on what Windows magic it operates, but I used [this guide](https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/856020/Draw-Behind-Desktop-Icons-in-Windows-plus) to steer this project somewhere, 
and then figured how to use SDL2 with this, and so on and so on 

The animations made by yours truly, but can be changed to something other than falling particles
